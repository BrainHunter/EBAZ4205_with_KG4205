# EBAZ4205_with_KG4205
Example project for the EBAZ4205 in combination with KG4205 board
This project is based on [EBAZ4205_base_wo_crystal](https://github.com/BrainHunter/EBAZ4205_base_wo_crystal) 

# Status:	
Currently only VGA output is implemented. 
Camera is TBD.

## VGA
The VGA output is set to 640x480 and data is generated by the test pattern generator.
To activate the output use these register values:

```shell
#activate timing controller:
devmem 0x43c10000 32 5
#set image size in the tpg:
devmem 0x43c00010 32 480
devmem 0x43c00018 32 640
#set color bar pattern in the tpg: 
devmem 0x43c00020 32 0x9 
#enable the tpg:
devmem 0x43c00000 32 0x81 
```

## Camera
TBD.
